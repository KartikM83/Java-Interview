### 1. What are Access Specifiers and Types of Access Specifiers?

Access Specifiers in use to restrict the scope of a class, constructor, variable, method, or data member. There are four types of Access Specifiers in Java mentioned below:

1.  **Public -** The code is accessible for all classes
2.  **Private -** The code is only accessible within the declared class
3.  **Protected -** The code is accessible in the same package and **subclasses**. You will learn more about subclasses and superclasses.
4.  **Default -** The code is only accessible in the same package. This is used when you don't specify a modifier.
