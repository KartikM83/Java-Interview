### 1. What is an array in Java?
An **array** in Java is a **collection** of **similar types of data elements** that are stored in a **fixed-size** structure.
- once you assign the size of array it cannot change.
- The array element  can be access through the index 
- The array indexing always starts with zero.
```java
int[] Arr = new int[5];
```

### 2. On which memory arrays are created in Java?
-   The **array reference** is stored in the **stack** memory.
-   The **array data** (its elements) is stored in the **heap** memory.

(Heap Memory is the part of memory where objects (including arrays) are stored in Java. When you create an array, it is treated as an object, and therefore, it is allocated memory in the heap.)

### 3. What are the types of an array?
- ****Single-Dimensional Arrays:**** Arrays that have only one dimension
-   ****Multi-Dimensional Arrays:**** Arrays that have two or more dimensions such as two-dimensional or three-dimensional arrays.

### 4. What is the difference between int array[] and int[] array?
Both int array[] and int[] array are used to declare an array of integers in java. The only difference between them is on their syntax no functionality difference is present between them.

### 5. How to copy an array in Java?
-   ****clone() method in Java:**** This method in Java is used to create a shallow copy of the given array which means that the new array will share the same memory as the original array.
```java
int[] Arr = { 1, 2, 3, 5, 0};  
int[] tempArr = Arr.clone();
```

-   ****arraycopy() method:**** To create a deep copy of the array we can use this method which creates a new array with the same values as the original array.
```java
int[] Arr = {1, 2, 7, 9, 8};  
int[] tempArr = new int[Arr.length];  
System.arraycopy(Arr, 0, tempArr, 0, Arr.length);
```
-   ****copyOf() method:**** This method is used to create a new array with a specific length and copies the contents of the original array to the new array.
```java
int[] Arr = {1, 2, 4, 8};  
int[] tempArr = Arrays.copyOf(Arr, Arr.length);
```

-   ****copyOfRange() method:**** This method is very similar to the copyOf() method in Java, but this method also allows us to specify the range of the elements to copy from the original array.
```java
int[] Arr = {1, 2, 4, 8};  
int[] temArr = Arrays.copyOfRange(Arr, 0, Arr.length);
```

### 6. What do you understand by the jagged array?
A jagged Array in Java is just a two-dimensional array in which each row of the array can have a different length. Since all the rows in a 2-d Array have the same length but a jagged array allows more flexibility in the size of each row.

```java
int[][] Arr = new int[][] {  
 {1, 2, 8},   
 {7, 5},   
 {6, 7, 2, 6}  
};
```

### 7. What are the advantages and disadvantages of an array?

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
|--|--|
| Fast access to elements (O(1) time complexity) | Fixed size (cannot resize after creation) |
|  Simple to use and implement| Memory wastage if array is too large for data|
| Efficient use of memory|Cannot store different data types |
|Cache-friendly and good for large data sets|Inserting/deleting elements is inefficient|
| Easy to use in algorithms | Limited built-in methods for common operations |
