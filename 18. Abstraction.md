### . What is Abstraction?

Abstraction refers to the act of representing essential features without including background details. The detailed information or the implementation is hidden. The most common example of abstraction is a car, we know how to turn on the engine, accelerate and move, however, the way engine works, and its internal components are complex logic hidden from the general users. This is usually done to handle the complexity.

### 2. What is Abstract class?

A class declared as abstract, cannot be instantiated i.e., the object cannot be created. It may or may not contain abstract methods but if a class has at least one abstract method, it must be declared abstract.

### 3. When Abstract methods are used?

An abstract method is used when we want to use a method but want to child classes to decide the implementation in that case we use Abstract methods with the parent classes.

### 4.  Can an abstract class have a constructor?

Yes, an abstract class can have a constructor. Even though it cannot be instantiated directly, its constructor is executed when a subclass object is created. This is useful for initializing common properties and enforcing mandatory values.

### Example: Abstract Class with Constructor
```java
abstract class Animal {
    String name;

    // Constructor in abstract class
    Animal(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        System.out.println("Animal Constructor Called for: " + name);
    }

    abstract void makeSound(); // Abstract method
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    Dog(String name) {
        super(name); // Calls the constructor of Animal
        System.out.println("Dog Constructor Called");
    }

    @Override
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println(name + " barks!");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog d = new Dog("Buddy"); // Creating Dog object
        d.makeSound();
    }
}
```
