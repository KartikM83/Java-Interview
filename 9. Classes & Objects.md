### 1. What are Classes in Java?

A **class** in Java is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the **state** (variables) and **behavior** (methods) that objects of the class will have.

### 2. What is an object?
Object is a instance of class and it an entity that as state and behavior.

### 3. How is the ‘new’ operator different from the ‘newInstance()’ operator in Java?

the new operator is used to create objects, but if we want to decide the type of object to be created at runtime, there is no way we can use the new operator. In this case, we have to use the newInstance() method

### 4. What are the different ways to create objects in Java?
1.  Using new keyword
2.  Using new instance
3.  Using clone() method
```java
class Car implements Cloneable {
    String model;

    Car(String model) {
        this.model = model;
    }

    void display() {
        System.out.println("Car model: " + model);
    }

    @Override
    protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
        return super.clone();  // Using Object's clone method
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws CloneNotSupportedException {
        // Creating an object and then cloning it
        Car originalCar = new Car("Ford");
        Car clonedCar = (Car) originalCar.clone();
        
        clonedCar.display();  // Outputs: Car model: Ford
    }
}
```

4.  Using deserialization
5.  Using the newInstance() method of the Constructor class
