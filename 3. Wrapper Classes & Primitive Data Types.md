### 3. What is autoboxing and unboxing ?

**Autoboxing**: The automatic conversion of primitive types to their corresponding wrapper class objects. 

**Example**
```java
int num = 10;
Integer obj = num; // Autoboxing
```
**Unboxing**: The automatic conversion of wrapper class objects to their corresponding primitive types.

 **Example:**
 ```java
 Integer obj = 10;
int num = obj; // Unboxing
```
