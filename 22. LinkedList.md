## 🔥 LinkedList Question

### 1. Explain the LinkedList class.
LinkedList class is Java that uses a doubly linked list to store elements. It inherits the AbstractList class and implements List and Deque interfaces.

It allows **fast insertion and deletion** but is **slower for accessing elements** compared to `ArrayList`. LinkedList store the element as a node

### 2. How is LinkedList Different from ArrayList?


| Feature                   | ArrayList| LinkedList (Queue)        | 
|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------
| **Storage**               | ArrayList use daynamic array to store the element| LinkedList used double linked list to store the element
| **Storage Location** | In ArrayList, Elements are stored in contiguous memory locations               |LinkedList Elements are stored in non-contiguous memory locations as each element has a reference to the next and previous elements.                     
| **Accessing time**  | ArrayLists are faster for random access. And take time O(1)                | LinkedList is slower for random access than arraylist ans take time O(n)             
| **Insertiom and deletion time**  | ArrayList are slower for insertion and deletion operations take time O(n)               | LinkedLists are faster for insertion and deletion operations take time O(1)
| **Memory Usage**  | Less memory is used.              | More memory is used.
| **Type Of data**  | It is used to store only similar types of data            | It is used to store any types of data.


### 3. How Does LinkedList Work Internally?
LinkedList is used to store the element meaning each node as a data, previous pointer and next pointer

## ✅LinkedList  Notes




📌 **Key Features:**  
✅ Implements **List**, **Queue**, and **Deque** interfaces.  
✅ Elements are stored as **nodes (each has data + two references: prev & next)**.  
✅ **Faster insertion/deletion (O(1))** but **slower random access (O(n))**.
✅ LinkedList classes are non-synchronized.
✅ Maintains insertion order

#### **6️⃣ When to Use LinkedList?**

📌 **Use LinkedList when:**  
✔️ You need **frequent insertions/deletions** in the middle.  
✔️ You don't need **fast random access**.  
✔️ You are implementing **stacks, queues, or deques**.

📌 **Avoid LinkedList when:**  
❌ You need **fast searching (use ArrayList instead)**.  
❌ You have **memory constraints (it uses more memory due to extra pointers)**.

**LinkedList Example (Basic Operations)**

```java
import java.util.LinkedList;

class LinkedListExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LinkedList<String> list = new LinkedList<>();

        // Add elements
        list.add("Apple");
        list.add("Banana");
        list.add("Cherry");

        // Add at first and last
        list.addFirst("Mango");
        list.addLast("Orange");

        // Remove elements
        list.remove("Banana");  // Removes "Banana"
        list.removeFirst();  // Removes "Mango"
        list.removeLast();   // Removes "Orange"

        // Get elements
        System.out.println(list.get(0));  // Output: Apple
    }
}

```
