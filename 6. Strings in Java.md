## 1.  Why are strings immutable in Java?


In Java, strings are **immutable**, meaning their values **cannot be changed** once created. If you modify a string, a **new object is created** instead of modifying the existing one. This design provides **security, performance optimization, and thread safety**.

### **Reasons Why Strings Are Immutable:**

1.  **Security**
    
    -   Strings are widely used in **passwords, database connections, file paths, and network protocols**.
        
    -   If strings were **mutable**, an attacker could modify their values, leading to **security risks**.
        
2.  **String Pool Optimization**
    
    -   Java maintains a **String Pool** in heap memory to save space.
        
    -   If strings were mutable, modifying one string would **change all references**, leading to **unpredictable behavior**.
        
3.  **Thread Safety**
    
    -   Since strings are immutable, multiple threads can **share a string object without synchronization**.
        
    -   This prevents **race conditions** and improves performance.
        
4.  **Hash Code Consistency**
    
    -   Strings are commonly used as **keys in HashMap, HashSet, and HashTable**.
        
    -   If a string were mutable, its **hash code would change**, making it **unstable for hash-based collections**.
        
5.  **Performance Optimization**
    
    -   The **hash code of a string is cached**, improving performance in **hashing operations**.
        
    -   **Memory efficiency**: The **String Pool** allows Java to **reuse existing string objects**, reducing memory overhead.

### 2. What are the differences between String and StringBuffer?

**String**: 

 - String Is a **immutable** means once you assign the value to the string it cannot change.(If you try to modify String create new string object)
 - Because of the immutability of the String, If you perform many operation on string it will create new String object every time this leads to more memory usage and slower the performance.
 - Since `String` objects are **immutable**, they are **thread-safe** by nature. Multiple threads can access a `String` without synchronization issues.
 - Use `String` when you don't need to modify the string value frequently.
 
**StringBuffer**: 
 - `StringBuffer` is mutable, you can modify the value of the StringBuffer object without creating new object it allow you to change its content.
 - Because of the mutability of the StringBuffer, If you perform many operation on StringBuffer it will modify the contents of the existing `StringBuffer`without creating new object making it more efficient  memory usage and faster
 - **Thread-safe** because it has **synchronized methods**.
 - Use `StringBuffer` when you need to perform multiple modifications or concatenations of strings

**StringBuilder**

-The **`StringBuilder`** class in Java is similar to **`StringBuffer`**, but with one key difference: **`StringBuilder` is not synchronized**. This means that `StringBuilder` is not thread-safe, but it provides better performance than `StringBuffer` in situations where thread safety is not a concern.

### 3.  What is the difference between `==` and `equals()` for strings?
== Operator checks whether  the two string reference pointing to the same object in memory not the actual content of the string 

```java
String s1 = "Hello";
String s2 = "Hello";
String s3 = new String("Hello");

System.out.println(s1 == s2); // true (both point to the same object in the string pool)
System.out.println(s1 == s3); // false (s3 is a new object in heap memory)
 ```
equals method check whether  the two string matching the same sequence of character not memory location.

```java
System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); // true (same content)
System.out.println(s1.equals(s3)); // true (same content, different objects)
```
