### 1. What do you mean by data encapsulation?
Encapsulation means wrapping a data and information under a single unit.

### 2. What are the advantages of Encapsulation in Java?

**1. Data Hiding (Access Control)**  Data hiding means hiding the internal data within the class to prevent it direct access form the outside the class

```java
class Person {
    private String name; // private field (encapsulated)
    
    // Getter method
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
    
    // Setter method
    public void setName(String name) {
        if(name != null && !name.isEmpty()) {
            this.name = name;
        }
    }
}

```

Here, the  `name`  field is  **private**, and it cannot be directly accessed from outside the  `Person`  class. Instead, we control access via the  **getter**  and  **setter**  methods.

**2. Improved Maintainability**:

When you encapsulate data within a class, any changes to the internal workings (implementation details) of the class do not affect other parts of the program. As long as the public interface remains the same (the getters and setters), you can modify the internal implementation without worrying about breaking other code that uses the class.

**3. Increased Flexibility and Reusability**:

Encapsulation makes it easier to change or extend the functionality of a class. Since the implementation is hidden from the outside, you can modify it without disrupting other parts of the application. Additionally, classes that use encapsulation are more reusable because the internal behavior is abstracted away.

**4. Control Over Data**:

hrough encapsulation, you can control how data is accessed and modified. For example, you can include validation logic in setters to ensure that only valid data is assigned to a variable. This ensures that the object is always in a valid state.

### 3. What is the primary benefit of Encapsulation?

The primary benefit of  **Encapsulation**  in Java is its ability to  **protect the internal data**  from unauthorized access and modification. By hiding the implementation details of a class and only exposing a public interface (via methods like getters and setters), it ensures that the internal state of an object cannot be directly manipulated from outside the class.
