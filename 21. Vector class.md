### 1. What is a Vector in Java?
In Java, a Vector is a class in the java.util package that implements a growable array of objects. It is similar to an ArrayList, but with some key differences. A Vector can dynamically resize itself when elements are added or removed, making it a resizable array. It is synchronized and thread-safe. However, because of its synchronization overhead, it is rarely used in modern applications. In most cases, an ArrayList is preferred over a Vector, unless thread-safety is a concern and the overhead is acceptable.
