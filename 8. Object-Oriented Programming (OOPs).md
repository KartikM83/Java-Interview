### 1. What is an object-oriented Programming? 
**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. The primary concept of OOP is to create **objects** that interact with each other to perform tasks.

### 2. What is the difference between an object-oriented programming language and an object-based programming language?

An **object-oriented programming language** is a programming language that fully supports the principles of **object-oriented programming**, including all four key OOP concepts: **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, and **abstraction**.

**Examples**: Java, C#, etc.


An **object-based programming language** is a programming language that **supports objects** and **encapsulation**, but **lacks full support for inheritance** and/or **polymorphism**. These languages allow you to define and use objects, but they don't have all the features of  object-oriented programming languages.

**Examples**: Java script, visual basics, etc.
