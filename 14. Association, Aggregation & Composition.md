### 1. What is an association?

The association is a relation between two separate classes established through their Objects. It represents Has-A’s relationship.

### 2. What do you mean by aggregation?

[](https://github.com/KartikM83/Java-Interview/tree/main#62-what-do-you-mean-by-aggregation)

Aggregation is a type of relationship between two classes in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that represents a  **'has-a'**  relationship. It is considered a more specialized version of association and typically denotes that one class  **contains**  or  **owns**  references to objects of another class.

For example, consider a  **Library**  class and a  **Book**  class. The  **Library**  can contain multiple  **Books**, but if the library is deleted, the books can still exist independently.

```java
// Book class represents the part
class Book {
    private String title;

    public Book(String title) {
        this.title = title;
    }

    public String getTitle() {
        return title;
    }
}

// Library class represents the whole
class Library {
    private String name;
    private List<Book> books;

    public Library(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        this.books = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    public void addBook(Book book) {
        books.add(book);
    }

    public void showBooks() {
        System.out.println("Books in " + name + " Library:");
        for (Book book : books) {
            System.out.println(book.getTitle());
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create Books
        Book book1 = new Book("Java Programming");
        Book book2 = new Book("Data Structures");

        // Create Library and add Books
        Library library = new Library("City Library");
        library.addBook(book1);
        library.addBook(book2);

        // Show books in the library
        library.showBooks();
    }
}
```

### 3. What is the ‘IS-A ‘ relationship in OOPs Java?

[](https://github.com/KartikM83/Java-Interview/tree/main#63-what-is-the-is-a--relationship-in-oops-java)

‘IS-A’ is a type of relationship in OOPs Java where one class inherits another class.

### 4. What is the composition of Java?

[](https://github.com/KartikM83/Java-Interview/tree/main#64-what-is-the-composition-of-java)

Composition implies a relationship where the child  **cannot exist independently**  of the parent. For example Human heart, the heart doesn’t exist separately from a Human.

### 5. State the difference between Composition and Aggregation.

| **Aspect**                       | **Aggregation**                                         | **Composition**                                       |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Relationship**                 | Defines a “has a” relationship between the objects.    | Represents the part-of relationship.                 |
| **Object Dependency**            | Objects are independent of each other.                 | Objects are dependent on each other.                 |
| **Representation**               | Represented by using an empty diamond (◯).             | Represented by using a filled diamond (♦).           |
| **Lifetime of Child Objects**    | Child objects don’t have a lifetime.                   | Child objects have a lifetime.         
| **Ownership**                 | Weaker ownership; parent object does not own the child object    | Strong ownership; parent object owns the child object                |
| **Existence**            | Child object can exist independently and be shared            | Child object exists as long as the parent exists          |
| **Example**               | Library has Books (Books can exist outside the Library)            | Human has a Heart (Heart cannot exist without Human)   |
