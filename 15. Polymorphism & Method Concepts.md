Polymorphism is same entity ( Function and Object ) behaves different in different scenarios

### 2. What is runtime polymorphism or dynamic method dispatch?

[](https://github.com/KartikM83/Java-Interview/tree/main#68-what-is-runtime-polymorphism-or-dynamic-method-dispatch)

**Runtime Polymorphism**  (also called  **Dynamic Method Dispatch**) is a concept in object-oriented programming where the method to be invoked is determined at  **runtime**  based on the  **object type**, not the reference type.

This is achieved through  **method overriding**, where a subclass provides its own implementation of a method already defined in its superclass.

```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Cat meows");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myAnimal = new Animal();  // Animal reference, Animal object
        Animal myDog = new Dog();         // Animal reference, Dog object
        Animal myCat = new Cat();         // Animal reference, Cat object

        myAnimal.sound();  // Output: Animal makes a sound
        myDog.sound();     // Output: Dog barks
        myCat.sound();     // Output: Cat meows
    }
}
```

### 3. What is method overriding?

[](https://github.com/KartikM83/Java-Interview/tree/main#69-what-is-method-overriding)

**Method Overriding**  is a feature in Java that allows a  **subclass**  to provide a  **specific implementation**  of a method that is already defined in its  **superclass**, with the  **same method signature**  (method name, return type, and parameters). This is a form of  **run-time polymorphism**  because the method to be called is determined at  **run time**  based on object type

### 4. What is method overloading?

[](https://github.com/KartikM83/Java-Interview/tree/main#70-what-is-method-overloading)

method overloading is feature in java that allow you define the multiple method with same name but different parameters. This is a form of  **compile-time polymorphism**  because the method to be called is determined at  **compile time**

In Method overloading compared to the parent argument, the child argument will get the highest priority.

```java
class Calculator {
    // Method to add two integers
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    // Overloaded method to add three integers
    int add(int a, int b, int c) {
        return a + b + c;
    }

    // Overloaded method to add two doubles
    double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calculator calc = new Calculator();

        // Calling overloaded methods
        System.out.println(calc.add(5, 10));        // Calls add(int, int)
        System.out.println(calc.add(5, 10, 15));    // Calls add(int, int, int)
        System.out.println(calc.add(5.5, 10.5));    // Calls add(double, double)
    }
}
```

### 5.  Can you override a `static` method? Why or why not?
No, static methods cannot be overridden in Java because  **Static methods belong to the class, not instances.**
    
**Method overriding is based on runtime polymorphism, which only applies to instance methods.**
    
 Since static methods are **resolved at compile-time**, overriding them is **not possible**.
    

However, **we can redefine a static method in a child class**, but this is called **"method hiding," not overriding**. In this case, the method call **depends on the reference type, not the object**.

```java
class Parent {
    static void show() {
        System.out.println("Parent's static method");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    static void show() { // Hides Parent's method
        System.out.println("Child's static method");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parent parentObj = new Parent();
        Parent childObj = new Child(); // Reference of Parent, object of Child
        Child child = new Child();

        parentObj.show();  // Calls Parent's method
        childObj.show();   // Calls Parent's method (No overriding!)
        child.show();      // Calls Child's method
    }
}
```

### 6. Can we override the overloaded method?

[](https://github.com/KartikM83/Java-Interview/tree/main#72-can-we-override-the-overloaded-method)

Yes, we override the overloaded method

---

### 7. Can we overload the main() method?

[](https://github.com/KartikM83/Java-Interview/tree/main#73-can-we-overload-the-main-method)

Yes However, like any other method in Java, you can overload the  `main()`  method by providing different parameter lists. The method name (`main`) remains the same, but you can define multiple versions of the method with different parameters.

### 8. What are method overloading and method overriding?

****Method Overloading:**** It is also known as Compile Time Polymorphism. In method overloading two or more methods are shared in the same class with a different signature.

****Method Overriding:**** Method Overriding occurs when a subclass can provide the implementation of a method which is already defined in the parent class or superclass. The return type, name and arguments must be similar to the methods in superclass.

| **Aspect**                               | **Method Overloading**                                         | **Method Overriding**                                       |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**                           | When two or multiple methods are in the same class with different parameters but the same name. | When a subclass provides its own implementation of a method that is already defined in the parent class. |
| **Inheritance**                          | Method overloading can only happen in the same class or between a subclass and a parent class. | Method overriding can only happen in a subclass.            |
| **Error Detection**                      | When an error occurs, it is caught at compile time.            | When an error occurs, it is caught at runtime.              |
| **Polymorphism Type**                    | Example of Compile Time Polymorphism.                          | Example of Run Time Polymorphism.                           |
| **Inheritance Requirement**              | Method overloading may or may not require inheritance.         | Method overriding always needs inheritance.                 |
| **Location**                              | It occurs within the class.                                   | It is performed in two classes with an inheritance relationship. |

### 9. What is covariant return type?


It is a concept in object oriented programing where the method in subclass overrides the method in superclass and the return type of the override method is subtype of the return type of the superclass.

```java
class Animal {
    Animal makeSound() {
        return new Animal();
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    Dog makeSound() {  // Covariant return type
        return new Dog();
    }
}
```
---


### 10. Can we override the private methods?

It is not possible to override the private methods in Java. Method overriding is where the method in the subclass is implemented instead of the method from the parent class. The private methods are accessible only within the class in which it is declared. Since this method is not visible to other classes and cannot be accessed, it cannot be overridden.

----

### 11. Can we change the scope of the overridden method in the subclass?

In Java, it is not possible to modify the overridden method’s scope. The subclass method’s scope must be equal to or wider than the Superclass method’s overridden method’s scope. The overridden method in the subclass, for instance, can have a public scope or a more accessible scope like protected or default if the overridden method in the superclass has a public scope. It cannot, however, have a more exclusive scope like private.

---

### 12. Can we modify the throws clause of the superclass method while overriding it in the subclass?

We can modify the throws clause of the Superclass method with some limitations, we can change the throws clause of the superclass method while overriding it in the subclass. The subclass overridden method can only specify unchecked exceptions if the superclass method does not declare any exceptions. If the superclass method declares an exception, the subclass method can declare the same exception, a subclass exception, or no exception at all. However, the subclass method cannot declare a parent exception that is broader than the ones declared in the superclass method.

----

### 13. Can you have virtual functions in Java?

Yes, Java supports virtual functions. Functions are by default virtual and can be made non-virtual using the final keyword.
