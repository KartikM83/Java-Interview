### 1. Differentiate between instance and local variables.
**Instance Variable**
-   It is declared outside the method, constructor or block and directly invoked by the method.
-  It has default value.
-  It can be used throughout the class.
- Lifespan as long as the  object is exists

**Local Variable:** 

- It is declared within the method or block .
 - No default value
-  The scope is limited to the method.
- Lifespan  As long as the method/block is executing

### 2.  Explain the difference between instance variable and a class variable.

**Insatnce Variable**
- Instance variable is a variable that are associated with the instance of the class. Every object of the class has it own copy of the instance variable
-  Instance variable are declared without the static keyword inside a class but outside any method or block.
-  Lifespan  Lifespan as long as the  object is exists
-  Stored in **heap memory** (one copy per object)

**Class Variable ( Static variable )**

-  A class variable is a variable that is shared by all instances (objects) of a class. There is only one copy of the variable within the class.
-   Static variable are declared the static keyword inside a class but outside any method or block.
-  Lifespan  Lifespan as long as the  class is exists
-  Stored in **method area** (one copy for the class)

### 3. What is the difference between System.out, System.err, and System.in?
**System.out**
- It us used to print the output to the terminal
- It is a instance of printStream so we can use method like println(), print(), printf()

**System.err**

-It used to display the error message.
-It is a instance of printStream so we can use method like println(), print(), printf()

**System.in**
-It is used to take inputs from the user 
- It is an instance of `InputStream`, which allows you to read bytes from the standard input.
- We canâ€™t use the System.in directly so we use Scanner class for taking input with the system.in.

### 4. Difference in the use of print, println, and printf.

**1. Print**:  Used to output text without moving to a new line.
**2. Println**: Prints the text followed by a new line.
**3. Printf**: Used for formatted output.

### 5.  What will be the initial value of an object reference which is defined as an instance variable?

The initial value of an object reference which is defined as an instance variable is a NULL value.
