### 1. Define Inheritance.


Inheritance is a concept in which the child class inherited all the properties and characteristic from parent class

### 2. What are the different types of inheritance in Java?


Inheritance is the method by which the Child class can inherit the features of the Super or Parent class. In Java, Inheritance is of four types:

-   **Single Inheritance:**  when a subclass inherits from a single superclass this is called single inheritance . This is the most common type of inheritance in Java.
```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("The dog barks.");
    }
}
```

-   **Multilevel Inheritance:**  When a class is derived from another derived class, creating a chain of inheritance is called as Multilevel Inheritance So, a subclass can inherit from another subclass.

```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("The dog barks.");
    }
}

class Puppy extends Dog {
    void play() {
        System.out.println("The puppy plays.");
    }
}
```
-   **Hierarchical Inheritance:**  When multiple subclasses derive from the same parent class is known as Hierarchical Inheritance. In other words, a class that has a single parent has many subclasses.
```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("The dog barks.");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    void meow() {
        System.out.println("The cat meows.");
    }
}
```
-   **Multiple Inheritance:**  When a child class inherits from multiple parent classes is known as Multiple Inheritance. In Java, it only supports multiple inheritance of interfaces, not classes.
```java
interface Animal {
    void eat();
}

interface Pet {
    void play();
}

class Dog implements Animal, Pet {
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("The dog eats.");
    }
    
    public void play() {
        System.out.println("The dog plays.");
    }
}
```

### 3. What is multiple inheritance? Is it supported by Java?


Multiple inheritance is a concept in which a child class inherits from multiple parent classes is known as Multiple Inheritance.

**No**,  **Java does not support multiple inheritance**  with  **classes**. This is done to avoid Confusion and complexity, such as the  **diamond problem**, where a class inherits from two classes that have a method with the same name, leading to confusion which method the subclass should use.

### 4. How is inheritance in C++ different from Java?


**1. C++**

-   C++ support multiple inheritances.
    
-   In C++ by default access modifier of the class is private but while inheritance you can change the access modifier of the inherited member using public, private, protected.
    
-   Constructors are  **not inherited**  in C++.
    
-   When a class is created in C++, it doesn’t inherit from the object class, instead exists on its own.
    

**2. Java**

-   Java doesn’t support multiple inheritances.
    
-   In java by default access modifier of the class is private and Inheritance in Java follows the same principle as C++ but has more restricted default behaviors, especially with respect to  **protected**  and  **private**  access.
    
-   In Java, the  **constructor of the parent class**  is called  **automatically**  by the constructor of the subclass. If the parent class has a constructor with parameters, you must explicitly call it using  `super()`.
    
-   Java is always said to have a single inheritance as all the classes inherit in one or the other way from the object class.

### 5. Is there any limitation to using Inheritance?


Yes, there is a limitation of using Inheritance in Java, as because of inheritance one can inherit everything from super class and interface because of which subclass is too clustered and sometimes error-prone when dynamic overriding or dynamic overloading is done in certain situations.
