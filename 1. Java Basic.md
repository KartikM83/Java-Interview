### 1. Is Java Platform Independent if then how?
Yes, Java is a Platform Independent language javac compiles the program to form a bytecode this bytecode is a platform independent so to run these bytecode we need jvm preinstalled in the operating system Although ****JVM is platform dependent****,
so the bytecode can be created on any system that makes java platform independent

### 2.  Why is Java considered a "write once, run anywhere" language?
Java is considered a 'write once, run anywhere' language because the Java compiler (javac) compiles the Java program into **bytecode**, which is platform-independent. This bytecode can run on any operating system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making Java highly portable.

### 3. What is JVM?
The JVM stand for java virtual machine it is responsible for loading,  verifying and executing the bytecode

---
### 4. What is JIT ?
- JIT is a Just in time compilation.  This technique is used by the JVM to improve the performance  of the java program

- it is resposible for converting the bytecode into native machine code at runtime before the code is executed

---
### 5. What Is JRE ? 
JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment, it is an installation package that provides an environment to run the Java program on any machine.

---

### 6. What is JDK? 
JDK stands for Java Development Kit which provides the environment to develop and execute Java programs. JDK is a package that includes two things Development Tools to provide an environment to develop your Java programs and, JRE to execute Java programs or applications.

### 7. What is a classloader?
Classloader is the part of Java Runtime Environment during the execution of the bytecode the  classloader is responsible for dynamically loading the java classes and interfaces to JVM  Because of classloaders Java run time system does not need to know about files and file systems.

 ✅ Types of ClassLoaders: 
 - 1️⃣ Bootstrap ClassLoader – Loads core Java classes from the `rt.jar` (runtime jar)
 - 2️⃣ Extension ClassLoader – Loads Java extension libraries 
 - 3️⃣ Application ClassLoader – Loads application classes (.class files)

### 8. What is Java String Pool?
A string pool is a place i  heap in which all the string defined in the program are stored and there is a separate place in stack in which the variable is store that pointing the string value .
