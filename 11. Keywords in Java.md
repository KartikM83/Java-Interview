### 1. What is this keyword in Java?


‘this’ is a keyword used to reference a variable that refers to the current object.

### 2.  What is the `super` keyword in Java? 

The `super` keyword in Java is used to **refer to the parent class**. It is commonly used to access the **methods, variables, and constructors** of the parent class. It helps **resolve conflicts** when a child class overrides methods or has variables with the same name as the parent class.

### Example 1: Using `super` to Access Superclass Methods
```java
class Parent {
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Parent class method");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Child class method");
    }

    void show() {
        super.display(); // Calls Parent class method
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Child obj = new Child();
        obj.show();
    }
}
```
### Example 2: Using `super` to Access Superclass Fields
```java
class Parent {
    String name = "Parent Class";
}

class Child extends Parent {
    String name = "Child Class";

    void display() {
        System.out.println("Child name: " + name);
        System.out.println("Parent name: " + super.name);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Child obj = new Child();
        obj.display();
    }
}
```
### Example 3: Using `super()` to Call the Parent Class Constructor
```java
class Parent {
    Parent() {
        System.out.println("Parent class constructor");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    Child() {
        super(); // Calls Parent constructor
        System.out.println("Child class constructor");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Child obj = new Child();
    }
}
```

### 3. What is the transient keyword?


The transient keyword is used at the time of serialization if you don't want to save the value of the variable in file. JVM compile the code but ignores the original value and set the default value of the data type.


### 4. What is the difference between static (class) method and instance method?



| Features | **Static Method** | **Instance Method** |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **Belongs To** | Static method is belong to the class not to specific object.  | Instance method Belongs to an object of the class.  |
| **Declared with** |  It Is Define Using Static Keyword. | Not define with the Static keyword |
| **Access to variables and Method** | Static methods can access only static variable and method of the class.  | Instance method can access both **static** and **instance** variables and method of class |
| **Invocation** | Static methods can be called using the class name only without creating an instance of a class. | The instance methods can be called on a specific instance of a class using the object reference.|
| **Access to `this`** | Static methods do not have access to ****this**** keyword | Instance methods have access to ****this**** keyword|
| **Overridden** |Static methods cannot be overridden because they are resolved at compile time, not at run time. | Instance methods can be overridden because they are resolved at run time, not at compile time|
