### 1. What are operators?

Operators are the special types of symbols used for performing some operations over variables and values

---

### 2. Explain the difference between >> and >>> operators.

**>>**: Shifts the bits of a number to right by specified number of position and it preserve the sign of the number 
- For **Positive number** the leftmost bits filled with zero
- For **Negative number** the leftmost bits filled with  1
- This is called an **Arithmetic Shift**.

**Example**
```java
int a = 8;     // In binary: 1000
int b = a >> 2; // Shift right by 2 positions
System.out.println(b); // Output: 2 (binary 0010)
```

```java
int c = -8;    // In binary (32-bit): 11111111111111111111111111111000
int d = c >> 2; // Shift right by 2 positions
System.out.println(d); // Output: -2 (binary 11111111111111111111111111111110)
```

**>>>**: Shifts the bits of number to right with the specified number of position but it treat number unsigned

 - It filled leftmost bits with 0 even the number eighter **Positive** or **Negative**
 - This is called a **Logical Shift**.
 
 **Example**
```java
int a = 8;     // In binary: 1000
int b = a >>> 2; // Shift right by 2 positions
System.out.println(b); // Output: 2 (binary 0010)
```
```java
int c = -8;    // In binary (32-bit): 11111111111111111111111111111000
int d = c >>> 2; // Shift right by 2 positions
System.out.println(d); // Output: 1073741822 (binary 00111111111111111111111111111110)
```

### 3. Which Java operator is right associative?
There is only one operator which is right associative which is = operator.

-   **Left-associative** (the default for most operators): Operators are evaluated from **left to right**.
-   **Right-associative**: Operators are evaluated from **right to left**.

### 4. What is dot operator?
The **dot operator (`.`)** is used to access members (like fields, methods, or properties) of an object or class
