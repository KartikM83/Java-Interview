### 1.  How does Java handle memory management?
Java handles memory management **automatically** through the **Garbage Collector (GC)** and a **managed memory model**.

The **JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is divided into different memory regions:**

-   **Heap Memory:** Stores objects and is managed by the GC.
    
-   **Stack Memory:** Stores method call frames, local variables, and object references.
    
-   **Class Area (Method Area / Metaspace in Java 8+):** Stores class metadata and bytecode.
    
-   **Program Counter Register:** Holds the address of the currently executing instruction.
    
-   **Native Method Stack:** Used for executing native (non-Java) methods.
    

The **Garbage Collector automatically removes unused objects**, freeing up memory in the background and improving efficiency.

### 2 . What are Memory storages available with JVM?
1) **Class Area:** Stores class-level data, such as class definitions, static variables, method definitions, and metadata related to loaded classes.

2) **Heap:** Stores objects and their associated instance variables at runtime.
3) **Stack:** Stores local variables and function/method call data (activation records).
4) **Program Counter Register:** stores the address of the Java virtual machine instruction currently being executed.

5) **Native method Stack:** stores all the native methods used in the application.

### 3. What is the difference between Stack and Heap memory?
Stack is used for storing local variables and method calls, while Heap is used for storing objects and class instances. Stack is faster and managed by the JVM, whereas Heap is slower and managed by the Garbage Collector. Stack memory is short-lived, whereas Heap memory exists until GC removes unused objects. If Stack overflows, it throws StackOverflowError; if Heap is full, it throws OutOfMemoryError.

```java
class Example {
    static int x = 10;  // Stored in Method Area (not Stack/Heap)

    void method() {
        int a = 5;  // Stored in Stack
        String str = new String("Hello");  // `str` (reference) in Stack, but object in Heap
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Example obj = new Example();  // obj reference in Stack, object in Heap
        obj.method();  // Stack frame created for method()
    }
}
```

### 4.  What is garbage collection in Java?
Garbage collection in a java is the process of automatically identify and removed the unused  object  that are no longer needed from the heap memory and that preventing from the memory leaks and optimize the  memory usages.

ðŸ“Œ **Types of Garbage Collectors:**
ðŸ”¹ **Serial GC** 
- Uses single thread to perform garbage collection 
- It is simple form of garbage collection.
- Suitable for the application where the heap size is small and limited process.

ðŸ”¹ **Parallel GC** 
- Uses multiple threads to perform garbage collection 
- It aims to maximize throughput by performing minor GC in parallel and handling multiple threads.	
- Suitable for the application where the multicore system is required.

ðŸ”¹ **G1 GC** 
- Default in Java 11+, best for large apps
- The G1 Garbage Collector is designed to provide high throughput and low pause times
- Suitable for the application where  both high throughput and low pause times is required.

### 5.   How Garbage Collection Works

1.  **Object Creation:** When an object is created using the `new` keyword, it is stored in the heap memory.
    
2.  **Reference Management:** If no references point to an object, it becomes unreachable.
    
3.  **Garbage Collector Execution:** The JVM automatically detects unreachable objects and removes them from memory.
